## About Van Life

Van Life is a group class project we built together. It is a single-page app website that hosts vans for hire. We simulated a local server, and API calls are made to it to fetch data of the vans for display. We also incorporated sign in and authentication for the users that want to display their vans.

You are welcome to go through the repo files to have an insight on how much skills we covered. It was really enlightening.
